# 🚀 AWS Integration Proposal for Flyora Project

> **Frontend:** [flyora-frontend.vercel.app](https://flyora-frontend.vercel.app/)  
> **Backend:** [github.com/lodi-bui/Flyora-Backend](https://github.com/lodi-bui/Flyora-Backend)

## 📋 Executive Summary
This proposal outlines the integration of **AWS cloud services** with the existing Flyora application to enhance `scalability`, `reliability`, and `data processing` capabilities. The solution leverages **serverless architecture** to automate CSV data processing and provide robust API endpoints.

## ⚠️ Problem Statement
The current Flyora application lacks:
- 📁 Automated file processing capabilities
- 📊 Scalable data storage solution
- 🔗 Reliable API infrastructure
- 📈 Monitoring and logging systems
- 🔐 Secure access control mechanisms

## 🏗️ Solution Architecture

The e-commerce platform is designed using a **serverless and event-driven AWS architecture**, ensuring scalability, security, and cost efficiency. The solution integrates both a web-based storefront and an intelligent chatbot assistant to enhance user interaction. The key AWS services work together to manage authentication, data storage, backend logic, and conversational AI.
```
S3 → Lambda → DynamoDB → API Gateway → Client
```

### 🧩 AWS Services Used

| Service | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| **Amazon CloudFront** | Distributes website content globally with low latency and high transfer speed. |
| **AWS Amplify (Web Hosting)** | Hosts and deploys the front-end application (React or Next.js). |
| **Amazon Cognito** | Manages user registration, login, and secure authentication. |
| **Amazon API Gateway** | Acts as the main communication interface between the front-end and backend Lambda functions. |
| **AWS Lambda (API Handler)** | Handles API requests such as product listing, cart updates, and order management. |
| **AWS Lambda (Chatbot Handler)** | Processes chatbot logic, integrates with Amazon Lex, and retrieves data from DynamoDB or S3. |
| **AWS Lambda (Import CSV)** | Automatically imports product or order data from CSV files in S3 into DynamoDB. |
| **Amazon DynamoDB** | Serves as a NoSQL database storing users, products, and order records. |
| **Amazon S3** | Stores static assets such as product images and CSV files. |
| **Amazon Lex** | Powers the chatbot interface for natural language interaction. |

Amazon Lex: Provides the conversational interface (chatbot) to help users navigate the store or ask questions.
| Step | Source Service     | Target Service       | Purpose                           |
| ---- | ------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣    | `S3`                 | `Lambda Trigger`       | 🔄 Auto-trigger on file upload       |
| 2️⃣    | `Lambda Trigger`     | `DynamoDB`             | 📄 Read CSV files and import data    |
| 3️⃣    | `Lambda API Handler` | `DynamoDB`             | 🔄 Execute GET/POST operations       |
| 4️⃣    | `API Gateway`        | `Lambda API Handler`   | 🌐 Provide REST endpoints            |
| 5️⃣    | `IAM`                | `Entire System`        | 🔒 Access control management         |
| 6️⃣    | `CloudWatch`         | `Lambda & API Gateway` | 📊 Logging and monitoring            |

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### 🔧 Phase 1: Storage & Triggers
```bash
# S3 Bucket Configuration
aws s3 mb s3://flyora-data-bucket
aws s3api put-bucket-notification-configuration
```
- Configure `S3` bucket for file uploads
- Set up `Lambda` trigger for automatic processing

### 📊 Phase 2: Data Processing
```python
# Lambda Function Example
import json
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Process CSV from S3
    # Insert to DynamoDB
    return {'statusCode': 200}
```
- Develop Lambda functions for CSV parsing
- Configure DynamoDB tables for data storage

### 🌐 Phase 3: API Layer
```yaml
# API Gateway Configuration
swagger: '2.0'
paths:
  /data:
    get:
      x-amazon-apigateway-integration:
        type: aws_proxy
```
- Create API Gateway endpoints
- Implement Lambda API handlers

### 🔐 Phase 4: Security & Monitoring
- Configure `IAM` roles and policies
- Set up `CloudWatch` logging and alerts

## 📅 Timeline & Milestones

- 🗓️ **Week 1-2**: `S3` and `Lambda` trigger setup
- 🗓️ **Week 3-4**: `DynamoDB` integration and data processing
- 🗓️ **Week 5-6**: `API Gateway` and Lambda handlers
- 🗓️ **Week 7-8**: `IAM` security and `CloudWatch` monitoring
- 🗓️ **Week 9**: Testing and deployment

## 💰 Budget Estimation

| Service | Monthly Cost |
|---------|-------------|
| 🪣 **S3 Storage** | `$5-10` |
| ⚡ **Lambda Executions** | `$10-20` |
| 🗃️ **DynamoDB** | `$15-25` |
| 🌐 **API Gateway** | `$5-15` |
| 📊 **CloudWatch** | `$5-10` |
| **💵 Total** | **`$40-80/month`** |

## ⚠️ Risk Assessment

**🟢 Low Risk:**
- Service availability (`99.9% SLA`)
- Data security with AWS encryption

**🟡 Medium Risk:**
- Cost overruns with high usage
- Learning curve for team

**🛡️ Mitigation:**
- Implement cost alerts
- Provide AWS training
- Use reserved capacity where applicable

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

- ⚡ **Performance**: `50%` faster data processing
- 📈 **Scalability**: Handle `10x` current load
- 🔄 **Reliability**: `99.9%` uptime
- 💰 **Cost Efficiency**: `30%` reduction in infrastructure costs
- 🔐 **Security**: Enterprise-grade access controls
- 📊 **Monitoring**: Real-time system visibility
